# blackJackUnity

This is a Black Jack card game created in Unity (written in C#) and is based on Sloan Kelly's YouTube tutorial. 
It's pretty basic and straight-forward, with room for improvements.

This was mainly done for educational purposes, so that I would learn more about Unity and to get some of basics to 
create a card game of my own.

A build of the game can be found in the zip-file named GameBuild

Some future improvements that will be added as soon as there's time to do so (in no particular order):
* More appealing graphics/UI.
* Credits/cash to bet
* Menus and hi-scores
* Refactoring
* Make sure game objects aren't affected by screen resolution
